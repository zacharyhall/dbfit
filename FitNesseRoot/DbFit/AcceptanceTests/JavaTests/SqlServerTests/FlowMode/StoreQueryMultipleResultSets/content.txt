Create the procedure that has multiple result sets

!|Execute Ddl|!-
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TestStorQueryMultiResultSet]
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 1 as [One], 2 as [Two], 3 as [Three];

    SELECT 4 as [Four], 5 as [Five], 6 as [Six];

    -- result set that has no values
    SELECT 7 as [Seven], 8 as [Eight], 9 as [Nine]
    WHERE 1=0;

    SELECT 10 as [Ten], 11 as [Eleven], 12 as [Twelve];
END;

Test full length of result sets with a procedure that returns multiple result sets.

!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!- EXEC dbo.TestStorQueryMultiResultSet -!|firstresultset,secondresultset,thirdresultset,fourthresultset|

|Query|<<firstresultset|
|One  |Two    |Three   |
|1    |2      |3       |


|Query|<<secondresultset|
|Four |Five     |Six    |
|4    |5        |6      |


|Query|<<thirdresultset|
|Seven|Eight   |Nine   |


|Query|<<fourthresultset|
|Ten  |Eleven  |Twelve  |
|10   |11      |12      |


Make sure works for variable number of symbols less than number of result sets

!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!- EXEC dbo.TestStorQueryMultiResultSet -!|firstresultset2|


|Query|<<firstresultset|
|One  |Two    |Three   |
|1    |2      |3       |


!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!- EXEC dbo.TestStorQueryMultiResultSet -!|firstresultset2,secondresultset2|


|Query|<<firstresultset2|
|One  |Two    |Three    |
|1    |2      |3        |


|Query|<<secondresultset2|
|Four |Five     |Six     |
|4    |5        |6       |


Test with multiple select queries.
!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!-
SELECT 1 as [One], 2 as [Two], 3 as [Three];

SELECT 4 as [Four], 5 as [Five], 6 as [Six];
-!|firstresultset3,secondresultset3|


|Query|<<firstresultset3|
|One  |Two    |Three    |
|1    |2      |3        |


|Query|<<secondresultset3|
|Four |Five     |Six     |
|4    |5        |6       |


Test with multiple select queries, making sure it works for variable number of symbols less than number of result sets

!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!-
SELECT 1 as [One], 2 as [Two], 3 as [Three];
SELECT 4 as [Four], 5 as [Five], 6 as [Six];
-!|firstresultset4 |


|Query|<<firstresultset4|
|One  |Two    |Three    |
|1    |2      |3        |


Empty symbol list should not fail, just like when Store Query has empty symbol

!|Store Query Multiple Result Sets|!-
SELECT 1 as [One], 2 as [Two], 3 as [Three];
SELECT 4 as [Four], 5 as [Five], 6 as [Six];
